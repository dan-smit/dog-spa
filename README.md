# Introduction

The dog spa is a full-stack website for dog services that is Phillies themed. The purpose of this application is to get my hands dirty with React and become familiar with the interface.

### Installation and Running Application

Install all the dependencies or node packages used for development via terminal: `npm install`

Run the application via terminal: `npm start`

### Optimizations

With additional time, I would include more features to this site. For example, a reservation page for customers so that they can schedule appointments. Additionally, a 'Contact Us' page for any questions would be implemented. These additions would require state functionality in react to handle forms as well as a database to handle appointment scheduling.

### Lessons Learned

I had an easy time utilizing React components. I had two difficulties/lessons learned. My first issue was finding out how to implement the Phillies 1980's font. The only way to access it was to download it locally and utilize it in CSS from a local folder. The issue was that there was difficulty getting the font to render. I figured out that I had to download a VS code extension called iconfont-preview to load the ttf font file. The second issue I ran across was an error stating that my files with LF will be replaced with CRLF. I now have an understanding that LF and CRLF are line endings for windows (CRLF) and Unix and Linux (LF). I learned that when working with other developers that use different operating systems, this can be a concern that arises.
